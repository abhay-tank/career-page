Aim was to develop Raw Engineering careers page - https://www.raweng.com/careers using grid.

Grid is used to hold containers which is divided into 12 columns.
Rows of grid has been set to auto.
Grid template names has been used to position the containers.
Images are fetched directly from Raw CDN.

Approach is such, Navbar, Banner, Join Section, Jobs Section and Footer will cover all twelve columns.
However gallery section will cover 10 columns in middle and then is divided into 4:3:3 layout.
Upon small screen size each item of gallery will cover all 10 columns of gallery section and automatically shift other items on new row.

Demo is hosted at https://abhay-tank.github.io/career-page/
